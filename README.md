# InteractiveArt
The prototype is an interactive public-facing display board built with Arduino and p5.js that allows users to iteratively create their own art piece. It could potentially be found in a modern art museum and its target audience are art enthusiasts. 

There are multiple agents moving in a pseudo-random fashion within an art canvas, that the user can completely control using hardware. The user can change the agents number (count), width/size, colours, and movement (noise scale and strength), as well as the canvas’ background and alpha channel. A range of inputs are used such as a joystick to navigate and select options, a potentiometer enabling variable amount control (e.g., agent's count or agent’s width/size), and an ultrasonic sensor that generates a reverse movement effect when the user's hand is within 20 centimetres. The ultrasonic sensor also captures screenshots when the user places their hand on it for approximately 2 seconds. An LED strip acts as an output, lighting up an appropriate colour when the user is choosing a colour, making the process more immersive. My objective was to create a generative art project that is fun, gives users creative freedom, and employs a variety of meaningful inputs and outputs.
